This Directory I am going to try couple of things.
Aim is to try and do something specific and Document problems i face and solutions i find

0=) Specific Task 
Make two folders. One folder will have function module files, another will store data
outside both folders in this current directory, make a script that takes data from the data folder, uses functions of the second folder and outputs data into a new folder according to sub-directories.
The Parent Folder where this text file resides should be independent of which system it is 

1= )Working and Structure
bin -  will have modules
data - will have data
out - output folder that we should create

for drama lets do things iteratively for accesing data and giving out
scan images and do equalise correction of seperate color channels from historgram folder to accomplish this
run.py is wrapper script that uses functions from ./bin/module.py


+++++ case 1 +++++
importing key librares that functions in module.py need in run.py before we import module.py in run.py
